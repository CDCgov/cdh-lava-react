    :alt: The GIFT Principle

.............................................................................

   The largest impact to projects implementing the templates is
   based on process change rather than technical change. All implementations
   of DAVT should have a functioning report available in the first week and
   usually the first few days using data created for demonstration purposes.

   The key rule in implementing DAVT is to begin with the end in mind.

   For instance, during a typical implementation, data from current
   manually created customer reports are usually pasted into Excel, analyzed and
   used to create a data model and report mockup as a starting point for agile development.

.............................................................................

    The GIFT/DAVT services support over 100 use cases organized around 10 personas/roles.
    The templates have been used on 10 projects across 4 centers at the CDC.
    Most use cases in the templates fall into 5 top level swim lane processes

    The Ingress, Data load, Enrichment, Analysis and Serve processes form
    the five core pillar IDEAS of the templates.

    Documentation is only available internally at CDC while pending review.

Request Access to the GIFT/DAVT
===================================

All individuals that want to find out more about GIFT/DAVT that are on the CDC internal networks should request access.
There is a large amount of guidance and documentation that applies to developers and non developer roles.

To get access the GIFT/DAVT resources on github.

- Create a GitHub account

1. Register by either

- logging in with an existing personal GitHub account with your personal email login or
- register their CDC email.  However, you can register your CDC email with your GitHub account.

2. Associate GitHub Account with CDCEnt

- Complete: GitHub Enterprise [Cloud Access Request](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=aQjnnNtg_USr6NJ2cHf8j44WSiOI6uNOvdWse4I-C2NUQjVJVDlKS1c0SlhQSUxLNVBaOEZCNUczVS4u&wdLOR=c68990C94-A46B-467C-A841-B58D7BD9721D)
- You will receive email with instructions after completing the form: if you are approved for GitHub Enterprise Cloud usage as official user - you will receive an invite from GitHub to join the GitHub/CDCent organization using your username@cdc.gov email account (some invites get caught in our junk mail folders; and when you accept the invitation in your email, don"t use Internet Explorer\*). Your invitation expires in 7 days, so please accept. If it expires, we can recreate it, but then that will use up more time that we could be using on interesting things.
- VERY IMPORTANT: Be sure to accept the invite to join the cdcent organization. This is the step where many users experience problems.
- You can confirm your membership to the CDC organization by validating that there is a blue cdc badge at the bottom left of your github profile:
- First Steps: If you"d like to use your existing GitHub handle, please add and confirm your CDC email address with your GitHub account before you click the invite link. If you prefer, you can also create a 2nd GitHub account specifically for CDC projects, though this can be unwieldy to keep track of and so we do not recommend it.
- Once you accept your invite, you"re a member of the CDCent github organization. Please set up your profile with enough info to help you work better with your CDC colleagues, so people aren"t scratching their heads thinking "who the heck is washyohands77?" Complete your profile with at least the following information: more info

      -Your first and last name.

    * - **Location**
      - Your primary work location (city, state).
    * - **Photo**
      - A headshot photo, or an image that is unique to you. While technically the space invader icon that is automatically set up for noobs is unique, it"s hard to tell apart
